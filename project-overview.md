# Digital Kudos Wall - Project Overview

## Introduction

The Digital Kudos Wall is a hackathon project designed to create a web application that enables public recognition and appreciation among colleagues. This project addresses the need for fostering a positive workplace culture through a simple yet effective digital platform for giving and receiving recognition.

## Project Goals

1. **Foster Appreciation Culture**: Create a digital environment where team members can publicly recognize each other's achievements and contributions
2. **Simplify Recognition**: Provide an intuitive interface for creating and viewing kudos
3. **Generate Insights**: Deliver meaningful analytics that highlight recognition patterns and trends
4. **Demonstrate Best Practices**: Implement software development best practices in architecture, coding standards, and testing

## Target Users

- **Super Admin**: Users with full system access including user management, configuration, and all kudos operations
- **Admin**: Users with permissions to create, edit, and view kudos, as well as access to analytics
- **User**: Regular users with permissions to view kudos only

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript for type safety
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **State Management**: Next.js built-in state management or Context API
- **Routing**: Next.js file-based routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form

### Backend

- **API Framework**: Express.js (Node.js) with Typescript
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Database**: MySQL (SQL)
- **ORM**: TypeORM for database interactions
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI

### Layered Architecture

1. **Presentation Layer** (`src/presentation/*`):

   - Next.js components using Atomic Design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
   - Handle user interactions and input validation
   - Display data to users in appropriate formats
   - Use dependency injection to access application services
   - Never directly access domain or infrastructure layers

2. **Application Layer** (`src/application/*`):

   - Implement business logic and use cases
   - Coordinate between domain and infrastructure layers
   - Transform data using DTOs and mappers
   - Define interfaces for infrastructure implementations
   - Handle application-specific validation and business rules
   - No direct dependency on presentation or infrastructure implementation details

3. **Domain Layer** (`src/domain/*`):

   - Define core business entities and value objects
   - Represent business concepts and relationships
   - Implement domain-specific business rules
   - No dependencies on other layers
   - Use plain TypeScript
   - Highly testable with unit tests

4. **Infrastructure Layer** (`src/infrastructure/*`):
   - Implement data access through repositories
   - Handle external system communication
   - Implement interfaces defined by application layer
   - Adapt external systems to application needs
   - Manage database connections and queries
   - Handle JWT authentication mechanisms

## Key Features

### Kudos Creation and Display

- Form for creating kudos with recipient, team, category, and message
- Public kudos wall with card-based display
- Comprehensive search and filter functionality:
  - Filter by team, category, and recipient name
  - Filter by date range (from-to)
  - Search within kudos content
  - Sort by various criteria (newest, oldest, etc.)
  - Filter combinations for advanced querying
- User-friendly interface for applying and clearing filters
- Save favorite filter combinations
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

### User Management Dashboard (Super Admin)

- Approve or reject new user registrations
- Assign user roles (Admin or User)
- Manage existing user accounts
- View user activity logs

### Authentication System

- Secure registration with email validation
- Account approval workflow: New signups require Super Admin approval
- Super Admin can assign Admin or User role to new accounts
- Login with JWT token generation
- User session management
- Role-based access control (Super Admin, Admin, User)

### Analytics Dashboard

- Data visualization for recognition metrics
- Time-based filtering (weekly to yearly)
- Trending keywords analysis
- Export functionality for reports

### Testing Infrastructure

- Unit tests for business logic
- Component tests for UI elements
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
